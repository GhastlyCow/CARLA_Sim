This is some example code for Carla that has an ego vehicle driving straight with several NPC vehicles around it.

This was made for Carla 0.9.15 and runs on Town06 in Python 3.8.0.

Instructions to run code:

1. First install Carla 0.9.15 (https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases)
2. Then download the additional maps package (https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases)
   - You must extract the additonal maps zip file in the root folder of your windows Carla installation for it to work
3. Install carla (pip install carla)
4. place test_setup_1.py and traffic_manager_testing.py in ./PythonAPI/Examples

After completing these steps, running test_setup_1.py should spawn in an ego vehicle and 6 NPC vehicles on autopilot. These vehicles will drive for 20 seconds before the code finishes.

The ego vehicle will just drive forward in lane 2 of the highway. There will be several NPC vehicles, 2 of which are told to drive over the speed limit and more aggresively than the other NPC's.

traffic_manager_testing.py was used for initial testing and debugging of the traffic manager in Carla. This is the carla method used to control the NPC vehicles.
